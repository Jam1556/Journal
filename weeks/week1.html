            In Week 1, it was mostly an introductory week, introduction to JavaScript and GitHub etc.
            We then got setup in a Codewars group and did daily challenges to increase our knowledge of JavaScript
            and problem solving.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            During the week we got assigned some JavaScript challenges, we also connected these to GitHub.
            After we attempted the challenges, we took a screenshot and emailed our tutor.

        <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 40px;">JavaScript</p>
            
            
        <p>In JavaScript specifically, I was mainly shown and wrote basic syntax along with coding basics
            such as: dot notation, data types, methods, variable operators, functions, loops and if
            statements.
            This was all done in Visual Studio Code.
        </p>
                
        <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 40px;">GitHub</p>
            
            
        <p>To show our work to each other, we had to create repositories in our GitHub accounts and send the
            link to our tutors. We were shown what GitHub Desktop was and how to link it to our accounts on
            the browser version.
            For example, I created a repo called "projects" and sent the link via email but I push most of
            my changes on the desktop version just because it's easier (then I click "push origin" so the
            changes are confirmed in the browser).
