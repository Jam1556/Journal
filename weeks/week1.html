        In Week 1, it was mostly an introductory week, introduction to JavaScript and GitHub etc. 
        We then got setup in a Codewars group and did daily challenges to increase our knowledge of JavaScript and problem solving.
        </p>
                    
        <p>
        During the week we got assigned some JavaScript challenges, we also connected these to GitHub.
        After we attempted the challenges, we took a screenshot and emailed our tutor.

        <div class="js_sum"><p>In JavaScript specifically, I was mainly shown and wrote basic syntax along with coding basics such as: dot notation, data types, methods, variable operators, functions, loops and if statements. 
            This was all done in Visual Studio Code.

            <div class="gh_sum"><p>To show our work to each other, we had to create repositories in our GitHub accounts and send the link to our tutors. We were shown what GitHub Desktop was and how to link it to our accounts on the browser version.
                For example, I created a repo called "projects" and sent the link via email but I push most of my changes on the desktop version just because it's easier (then I click "push origin" so the changes are confirmed in the browser).
