    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In week 7, I was introduced to the popular JavaScript library React. We first covered components and created
            a practice app; this showed us how useful they can be by being reused anywhere in the application via the
            ‘import’ keyword.<br>
            Examples of functional and class components, as well as exporting and importing the files into the main app
            file. This is also known as passing props. <br>
            <!-- Components Images -->

            <img src="/images/component_example.PNG" alt="Component Example">
            <br>
            I was then told what hooks are, only ‘useState’ was the one we focused on at this current time. Functional
            components can be used with useState and pulls it through to the main file. This doesn’t work with Class
            components.<br>
            After this I was given a task to pass props from a function into our main file and give them some values.
            For example: name, age and favourite food.<br>

            <img src="/images/forms_example.PNG" alt="Form Example with useState"> <br>

            After this I used the map() method. This takes each element from the array and transforms it with a function
            you specify, which then outputs a new array in the same order. An example of map() method:<br>
            <!-- Map Method Image -->
            <img src=""> IMAGE HERE <br>

            Then I covered conditional rendering. Conditional rendering is basically an if statement but used in React,
            it can render different components if a condition is true or false.<br>
            <!-- Conditional Rendering Image -->
            <img src="/images/conditional_rendering_example.PNG" alt="Conditional Rendering"> <br>
            <div class="text-4xl underline">Creating a To-Do App</div>
            Finally, I was given a project that involves creating a to-do app. It involves all of the things above and
            ‘forms’. In the brief I was given
            it stated that I should create an app that allows the user to add and delete tasks to a list and use
            appropriate styling.
            It must use the '.map()' method, conditional rendering and import at least 2 React components.

            <img src="/images/to-do-completedtask.PNG" alt="Completing Tasks">

            These images are showing my React to-do app, how it works and what happens when you add a task and mark it
            as completed.

            <img src="/images/to-do-AppCode2.PNG" alt="App.js Code">

            This is the code that makes my To-do App work and most of the important parts of the program.
