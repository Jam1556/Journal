        <p>In week 7, I was introduced to the popular JavaScript library React. We first covered components and created a practice app; this showed us how useful they can be by being reused anywhere in the application via the ‘import’ keyword.<br>
            Examples of functional and class components, as well as exporting and importing the files into the main app file. This is also known as passing props. <br>

            I was then told what hooks are, only ‘useState’ was the one we focused on at this current time. Functional components can be used with useState and pulls it through to the main file. This doesn’t work with Class components.<br> 
            After this I was given a task to pass props from a function into our main file and give them some values. For example: name, age and favourite food.<br>
            <!-- Images -->
            After this I used the map() method. This takes each element from the array and transforms it with a function you specify, which then outputs a new array in the same order. An example of map() method:<br>
            <!-- Image -->
            Then I covered conditional rendering. Conditional rendering is basically an if statement but used in React, it can render different components if a condition is true or false.<br> 
            <!-- Image -->
            Finally, I was given a project that involves creating a to-do app. It involves all of the things above and ‘forms’.
