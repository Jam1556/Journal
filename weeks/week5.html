    <p> In week 5, I used JavaScript and SQL for the project and tasks I was given this week. My first task was relating to the JavaScript variable scope and higher order functions. There is the .map method which is an example of a higher order function. 
        I used this with a variable containing 5 numbers and iterated through it whilst multiplying them by 3. See screenshot below:

    <p>The next task was to test an already created function and see if it works by passing a number and an operator into the “doMaths” function, see below:</p>

    <p> During this time, I was also asked to create a database comprised of many tables. These tables contained made up data with client’s name, addresses, email addresses, website name, their domain name, which developer is creating their website,
        whether they want CSS/Shopping cart or not, number of pages and some developer details too. I put these into a schema and created all the tables I needed:

    <img src="/images/websitetable1.png" alt="Website Table" style="width: 700px; height: 300px;">
    <img src="/images/domaintable1.png" alt="Domain Table">
    <img src="/images/devtable1.png" alt="Developer Table">
    <img src="/images/styletable1.PNG" alt="Style Table">
    
        
    <p> After that I was given a couple of activities that involved amending records, adding a record and deleting a record. Then to show specific parts of the database; for example: every site that has the domain name .co.uk or all the websites being worked on by a certain developer.
    <br> Here I'm amending a record for Ivana Sparrow, her domain name should be .com, not .co.uk. 
    </p>

    <p>Now I've changed the DomainID to "DN005" which is .com:</p>

    <p>In the screenshot below, it shows me adding a new record to my table.</p>

    <p>Next I was told to delete a record from the table, specifically the information for Chris Illingworth. The image below shows his record being removed.</p>

    <p>Finally, I was told to get specific data from the database by using the "WHERE" keyword in SQL. This can range from finding out which customers want their websites to have
        a shopping cart, to include css to which developers are working on who's website and which branch they are with.
