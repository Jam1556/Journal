    <p>In week 6, I was tasked with a group project. This project was completely ran in the terminal, just raw JavaScript.</p>

    <p>I was given a group challenge with 2 other people to create an escape room with JavaScript. The requirements were: At least 4 uses of interaction with inquirer, 4 functions that change or decide the userâ€™s path and show an example of a class and subclass.
        We were also told to create a user flow chart, put all of our code into a GitHub repository and use a Trello board (kanban style) to organize who is doing which task and where we were up to. 
        If we completed these with time to spare, we could customise our escape room by using the npm library, we mainly used chalk to add colour. Our project is below:

    <p>On the SQL side of things, I was introduced to MongoDB. I installed MongoDB Compass and mongosh.
        I then created a database, added some data and ran some queries to see if it was working.
