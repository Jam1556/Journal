        <p>In week 4 I have covered normalization. I have also been doing a lot of JS DOM and created a drumkit project.</p>

        <p>Normalization was the focus for this week on the database side of things. Working with sample data and putting it into 1NF, 2NF and then 3NF,
         introducing us to what normalization is and why it's important.

       This image is showing what we worked with and how we put it into 3NF (Third Normal Form).

        </p>

    <p>We were also given a project brief to create a drumkit that plays a sound when you click a specific button or a key. Link to my project is below:
