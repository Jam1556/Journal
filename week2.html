    <p>At the start of week 2, I was introduced to mainly more HTML, CSS and also SQL.</p>

    <p>
    <p style="font-size: 35px; text-decoration: underline;">HTML</p>
    With HTML in week 2, I shown how div, flexbox and other elements work. I used these alongside classes, elements and styles in my journal that you are currently reading.

    <p>
    <p style="font-size: 35px; text-decoration: underline;">CSS</p>
    When I was using CSS, it was for a project, a journal that covers my activities on this course. I was shown the different styles I can use and I played around with the other options to see what they are.
    From colours, font sizes, font family to margins and backgrounds, there was a lot to go through. I was even shown how flexbox converts over to css.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 35px; text-decoration: underline;">SQL</p>
    <p>In SQL and databases generally, I covered the basics like records, keys, data types and tables. A record is a row of information, normally personal information is stored here like first name, last name, address etc.
        Then you have the primary keys that define the records and tell you what they actually are, makes it easier to find specific info.
        Every record and primary key that you type in must be some kind of data type, whether it be a CHAR, INT, DATE or a boolean. It's up to you what you want it to be but most of the time it's going to be straight forward.
        For example: "FirstName" is going to be a CHAR, "PhoneNumber" is an INT, "D.O.B" will be DATE and "Employed" with true or false value applied would be a boolean data type.  
        Finally you have the table that brings it all together, it's what is made up of all the records, primary keys, fields and data types that you stored.
