        In Week 1, it was mostly an introductory week, introduction to JavaScript and GitHub etc. 
        We then got setup in a Codewars group and did daily challenges to increase our knowledge of JavaScript and problem solving.

        During the week we got assigned some JavaScript challenges, we also connected these to GitHub.
        After we attempted the challenges, we took a screenshot and emailed our tutor.
