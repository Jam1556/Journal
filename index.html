<div class="intro">
    <p>This is a journal about my time on a full stack coding course with the Growth Company.</p>
    <p>This course mostly covers the JavaScript programming language, studying it closely during week 1, due to it's popularity and usefulness in web/software development.
       In week 1 we also covered GitHub and created repositories and shared them with our tutors. I will go into more detail on this on my week 1 page. 
    </p>
    <p>Alongside JavaScript, this course also covers HTML and CSS in the early weeks so we are all familiar with creating sites like these. I mention more on this two on my week 2 page.</p>
    <p>Also during week 2 we went into SQL and database fundamentals like: keys, creating records, tables and an actual database using SQL. </p>
