<div class="intro">
    <p>This is a journal about my time on a full stack coding course with the Growth Company.</p>
    <p>This course mostly covers the JavaScript programming language, studying and using it from week 1, due to it's popularity and usefulness in web/software development.
       In week 1 we also covered GitHub and created repositories and shared them with our tutors. I will go into more detail on this on my week 1 page.
